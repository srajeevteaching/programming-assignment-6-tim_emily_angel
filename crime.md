# PA6: Crime

## Problem

Write a program that reads in the data from the file **crime.csv**, stores it in a list of lists, and then answers the following questions about that data. The program should give a menu with all options and should only end when the user chooses the option to end from the menu.

1. What has been the change in violent crime rate from 2010 to 2014? Is it significantly down, down, flat, up, or significantly up. You should consider a change of +/- 1 per 1000 to be no change. Changes for +/- 5 are significant. This information should be output for each neighborhood to a file that the user chooses.

2. Create a graph that shows the number of neighborhoods with low, moderate, and high numbers of adult arrests per 1,000 residents over the age of 18 in 2014. A low number is less than 20 and a high number is greater than 50.

3. Are juvenile arrest rates related to domestic violence and shootings? Find the average number of total juvenile arrests for each category of the DV-shootings column.

4. A question of your choosing!
